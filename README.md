A standard cryptarithmetic riddle would look like this:

With the goal being mapping each of the given letters to a number in a given base (eg. base 6).

String, String, String, int: The three words that constitute the "equation", followed by the base.

In the above example, the arguments would be: WON WON TOO 6.
